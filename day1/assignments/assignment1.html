      <h1>About Suresh Raina</h1>
      <p>
        Suresh Raina, known for his aggressive batting and outstanding fielding, is one of the most celebrated cricketers in Indian cricket history. Raina was an integral member of the Indian cricket team in limited-overs formats and played a key role in India's success in ICC tournaments.

        Raina was prodigious at the under-19 level, his run-scoring and a string of double-hundreds taking him to the Indian junior team and beyond it, to India colours. It took Raina five years to cement his place as an India regular, moving from being a limited-overs specialist who played 98 ODIs to one who became the 12th Indian to make a Test century on debut.

        Raina made his Test debut in Sri Lanka as a replacement for injured team-mate Yuvraj Singh, who, like Raina, was a left-hander, a dasher, and in the early 2000s, India's most athletic fielder. For a while it seemed Raina might have earned a long-term Test spot, but in England in 2011 his lack of skill against pace, seam and swing again opened up debates about his ability to be a consistent Test player for India.      </p>
